Ladies, Treat Your Heart Like Your Life depends on It
If You’re a Woman, Sadly, Heart Disease Will Most Likely Be Your Cause of Death…Until Now  
Will heart disease kill a woman in your life? 
If you are a woman reading this article, will heart disease take you to an early grave before your time?
If you choose NOT to gamble with your life, read on.
Heart Disease does not Play Fair
Heart disease has killed more than 314,000 women each year since 2018. 
But, despite significant increases in heart health awareness over the past decades, still only about half (56%) of women recognize that heart disease is their number 1 killer.
Heart disease kills more women than any other cause. It tops cancer, accidents and crimes of passion committed against women. 
And don’t be fooled by the hype that heart disease only affects older women or those experiencing menopause. 
Heart disease can also significantly impact young women too. 
According to the CDC, about 1 in 16 women aged 20 and older (6.2%) have coronary heart disease, the most common type of heart disease. 
1 in 5 young female deaths are attributed to heart disease.
Heart Disease kills women…thousands of women each year and will continue to kill thousands more without proactive immediate intervention—many of these deaths could have been prevented with changes made to attitudes, lifestyle and the significance of research on women’s heart health.
That’s why the HeartWISHH Women’s Heart Hearth was formulated in 2016. 
HeartWISHH, Women’s Heart Health Supplement, was developed by two female physicians who recognized that much of how heart disease affects women needed to be more urgently addressed as well as seeking more holistic natural treatments that could be safely used over a woman’s entire lifespan.  
Women’s bodies, especially, go through massive hormonal changes throughout her life cycle in terms of reproduction, menstruation, menopause and numerous other anatomical and physiological changes from a woman’s birth to her death. 
As a result of feminine changes over a lifetime, there are not any highly credible, scientifically supported supplements on the market designed specifically to meet the challenges of supporting 
the complexities of women’s health in general and her heart health in particular. 
The “WISHH” in HeartWISHH is an acronym for Women’s Innovative Supplement for Heart Health. Kind of catchy, huh? But do not let the word play on this power packed, proprietary, all-natural formula fool you. 
The HeartWISHH Women’s Heart Health Supplement formula is the only all-natural blend on the market of heart-support ingredients for safe use throughout a woman’s lifetime… 
… which includes puberty, pregnancy, menopause, smoking (and quitting), unrelated medical issues (diabetes, etc.) or medicines that could put a burden on the heart, and other life events or issues.
HeartWISHH just may be one of the single most important nutrients in saving millions of women’s lives. Its ingredients come from nature and are proven to be safe for women of all ages over her life span. 
You can’t beat nature when it comes to treatments designed to treat the nature of women’s bodies and her unique heart health requirements.
And a healthy heart IS a heart that can fight off the constant threats of disease that research shows have been the number one killer of women—heart disease.
HeartWISHH, an all-natural formula, “attacks” the threats that seem to cause heart disease in women (it offers several other health benefits as well). 

Heart Smart in a Nutshell
Since heart disease kills women… thousands of women each year, the odds of a woman dying from heart disease are high and can strike any woman at any age. 
Sadly, she might not even be aware that she has developed heart disease until it’s too late. 
The term heart disease includes several different types of heart conditions, including heart attack.
Heart disease is the number one killer of women in the United States, but we here at HeartWISHH want to change those dreadful numbers as well as these disheartening stats from the CDC.
According to research from the CDC:
Heart disease is the leading cause of death for women in the United States, killing 314,186 women in 2020—or about 1 in every 5 female deaths.
Heart disease is the leading cause of death for African American and white women in the United States. Among American Indian and Alaska Native women, heart disease and cancer cause roughly the same number of deaths each year. For Hispanic and Asian or 
Pacific Islander women, heart disease is second only to cancer as a cause of death.
About 1 in 16 women aged 20 and older (6.2%) have coronary heart disease, the most common type of heart disease:4
About 1 in 16 white women (6.1%), black women (6.5%), and Hispanic women (6%)
About 1 in 30 Asian women (3.2%)
What’s just as scary is that millions of women already have multiple risk factors that lead to heart disease, and they do not know it.
How many risk factors do you have? 
If you are not sure, it may already be too late to reverse the damage to arteries, and your circulatory system without risky, time-consuming surgery.
All women in the United States are at risk of developing and possibly dying from heart disease and as we age, the risks do increase, but young women are not immune to heart disease or its risk factors. 
A Woman Only Supplement to Challenge Heart Disease Risks
 HeartWISHH Women’s Heart Supplement can help to safely reduce risk factors responsible for the onset of heart disease over stages in a woman’s life span from her birth and beyond.
HeartWISHH Women’s Heart Health Supplement was developed by two female doctors, Dr. Shimiah Mohammed and Dr. Nadia Jackson, both world renowned scientists, highly noted on their work with cardiovascular health along with their recognized elite team of medical experts, noticed that women’s heart health needs have typically gone under-represented in the supplement industry.  
HeartWISHH Women’s Heart Health Supplements can only be purchased online to keep down the costs and for added convenience to you.
Some of the ongoing benefits of HeartWISHH Supplements include:
• Protection against the most common heart disease risks in women — and reduction of these risks: diabetes, mental stress and depression, smoking, inactivity, menopause, pregnancy, family history of early heart disease, and inflammatory diseases such as arthritis. The ingredients are formulated to support the prospect’s efforts to eat a healthy diet, manage stress, reduce or eliminate alcohol, and take or wean off blood pressure medications, etc. as she gets healthier thanks to HeartWISHH.
• Cleansing the body from toxins that can exacerbate heart disease risk in women: With a daily dose of its complex blend, women can count on HeartWISHH to deliver nutrients more effectively in the bloodstream, cleaning out and balancing the body’s systems that support a healthy heart. It’s not a “miracle” all by itself, but if women commit to taking this supplement 
once a day, it can go a long way toward enjoying better blood flow and cardiac health.
• Introducing the ideal combination of food nutrients into the body, for heart health: It’s been proven in a Harvard study (among others) that the best diet for preventing heart disease is full of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, nuts, fish, poultry, and vegetable oils (olive oil, for instance). The proprietary HeartWISHH formula combines the best nutrients from these heart-friendly foods with a unique and potent combination of herbs and minerals, to help women make sure they’re getting these benefits into their system, even without eating different foods each day.
• HeartWISHH formula benefits go way beyond just heart health.

The Risks to A Healthy Heart 
According to the Mayo Clinic (2019), the most common risk factors (many are preventable) associated with the onset of heart disease in women include:
• Diabetes. Women with diabetes are more likely to develop heart disease than are men with diabetes. Also, because diabetes can change the way you feel pain, you’re at greater risk of having a silent heart attack — without symptoms.
• Mental stress and depression. Stress and depression affect women’s hearts more than men. Depression makes it difficult to maintain a healthy lifestyle and follow recommended treatment.
• Smoking. Smoking is a greater risk factor for heart disease in women than it is in men.
• Inactivity. A lack of physical activity is a major risk factor for heart disease. Some research has found women to be less active than men.
• Menopause. Low levels of estrogen after menopause pose a significant risk of developing disease in smaller blood vessels.
• Pregnancy complications. High blood pressure or diabetes during pregnancy can increase the mother’s long-term risk of high blood pressure and diabetes. The conditions also make women more likely to get heart disease.
• Family history of early heart disease. This appears to be a greater risk factor in women than in men.
• Inflammatory diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and others can increase the risk of heart disease in both men and women.”
HeartWISHH Women’s Heart Supplements is developed to “attack” and “reverse” many of the risk factors that women can experience over her lifetime, which research shows can lead to heart disease.

Here’s what HeartWISHH customers are saying:
“I had a heart health scare about a year ago. I went to see my doctor because my heart was racing, and it was terrifying. My doctor told me that if I don’t start changing some lifestyle habits, I might be in big trouble. I had no idea! So, I started taking HeartWISHH because it’s for women specifically — and 
heart health support specifically. I’ve been taking it for a year and working on better eating habits overall. I just saw my doctor again, and she asked me, ‘What have you been doing? Your blood pressure is down and some of the other risk indicators have improved!’ I told her about HeartWISHH, and she was very impressed. She said she was less concerned about my cardiac health risks now, and to keep up the good work. Yay! I feel way less afraid now, and I’m sticking with HeartWISHH.”
— J. Harst
“Nobody expects to have a cardiac problem at age 32. But when I was pregnant with my second baby, I suddenly experienced heart palpitations. It was a super frightening time for me, my husband, and my doctor. We discussed finding some solutions that were safe during pregnancy. My doctor is a holistic osteopath, so she recommended that I give HeartWISHH a try. I didn’t notice anything immediately after starting to take it, but within a month, I was feeling better in every way. During the next month’s visit with my doctor, she was happy to see that I wasn’t experiencing palpitations anymore. I delivered a healthy baby girl and have been taking HeartWISHH ever since!”
— T Blessman
“Two of my aunts – as well as my dad–died young (in their 50s and 60s) due to cardiac issues and arteriosclerosis. At 63, I’m determined NOT to follow them to an early grave. Over the past decade, I had gotten lazy and overweight, thinking what’s the point since I was doomed to die young. But then I read about HeartWISHH and other ways to get myself in better shape heart-
wise. I’ve been taking HeartWISHH daily for about six months in combination with walking more… and darn it, I feel MUCH better! I no longer feel like I’m doomed or living under a ‘cardiac cloud.’ Not only that, but my skin, hair, and overall mood are in much better shape. It’s amazing. I’m more in charge of my future health, thanks to HeartWISHH.”
